				<p>GGC’s innovative practices, caring culture and extremely affordable tuition are changing the game in higher education, and changing the future for students at all levels, of all ages and from all walks of life.

				<br><br> GGC combines proven student/faculty engagement practices with small class sizes, individual attention, remarkable facilities, a diverse and inclusive culture and student mentoring to enhance student success. We call that transformative – for higher education in general, and for individual students in particular. That’s game changing.

				<br><br> GGC’s groundbreaking, four-year college model changes how educators facilitate and support student learning. The innovative model is characterized by GGC’s integrated approach to these three critical elements: attention, affordability and access.

				<br><br>&emsp; 1. Attention: GGC’s committed faculty and staff provide students with the support and tools they need to be successful in college and in life. 
				<br><br>&emsp; 2. Affordability: GGC offers a high-quality, attentive education for a lot less money.
				<br><br>&emsp; 3. Access: GGC opens the door to four-year degrees for more people, including those who might have never considered college. </p>
